# ARSXEngine üí∏üá¶üá∑

## Overview

**ARSXEngine** is a decentralized stablecoin engine designed to issue and manage **ARSX**, a crypto-collateralized stablecoin pegged to the Argentine Peso (ARS). Inspired by MakerDAO's DAI model and Patrick Collins' DSCEngine, this system aims to maintain a 1 ARSX = 1 ARS peg, while remaining overcollateralized and decentralized.

The protocol supports:

- **Overcollateralized minting** of ARSX.
- **Redemption and liquidation** mechanisms to keep the system solvent.
- Flexible governance parameters for risk management.
- Integration with custom ARS/USD price oracles (Chainlink Functions-based).

## Components

### Contracts

#### ARSXEngine.sol

- **Collateral management**: Deposit, withdraw, mint ARSX, and repay debt.
- **Liquidations**: Handles undercollateralized positions with a bonus for liquidators.
- **Health factor enforcement**: Ensures user positions remain healthy.
- **Governance functions**: Adjust liquidation thresholds, bonuses, and oracle freshness.

#### ARSXStableCoin.sol

- Minimal ERC20 implementation with minting and burning controlled by ARSXEngine.
- Provides the ARSX token used for debt representation and settlements.

## Features

‚úÖ Overcollateralized ARS-pegged stablecoin.  
‚úÖ Uses external crypto collateral (e.g., ETH or other ERC20 tokens).  
‚úÖ Supports partial liquidations with customizable bonus.  
‚úÖ Oracle freshness control to avoid outdated prices.  
‚úÖ Owner-controlled parameters (liquidation thresholds and bonuses).  
‚úÖ Inspired by DAI, but designed with no governance tokens, fees, or surplus mechanisms.

## Foundry Tests üß™

The repo includes a robust suite of tests using [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) to ensure core mechanisms work as expected.

**Test coverage:**

- Collateral deposits and withdrawals.
- Minting and burning ARSX.
- Combined deposit & mint workflows.
- Collateral redemption for ARSX.
- Health factor checks.
- Liquidations with price drops.

## Audits üîí

This repository includes two AI-based audits (from GPT-4o) covering:

- Security vulnerabilities.
- Gas optimizations.
- Best practice improvements.
- Code readability and maintainability suggestions.

---

## Documentation

- **Health factor**: Must remain ‚â• 1.0 to avoid liquidations. Calculated using collateral value vs ARSX debt.
- **Liquidation bonus**: Default 10%, configurable via governance.
- **Liquidation threshold**: Default 50%, requires 200% collateralization.

## Usage

### Example flow

1Ô∏è‚É£ User deposits collateral (e.g., ETH).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ User mints ARSX up to the allowed limit (based on health factor).  
3Ô∏è‚É£ User can repay ARSX to unlock collateral.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ If health factor drops below 1, position is eligible for liquidation.

## Governance

- Owner (initial deployer) can adjust risk parameters:
  - `liquidationThreshold`
  - `liquidationBonus`
  - Oracle staleness parameters
